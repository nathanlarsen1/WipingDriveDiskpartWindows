<h2>Project Walkthrough</h2>

<h3>1. Search for Command Prompt</h3>

I began by typing "Command Prompt" in the Windows search bar.</br></br>

<h3>2. Right-click and Run as Administrator</h3>
Then I right-clicked on the "Command Prompt" result and selected "Run as administrator."</br></br>

<br />
<br />
</p>

<h3>7. Disk Number</h3>

I carefully reviewed the list and identified the disk that I needed to wipe. I typed `select disk 1` and pressed Enter.<br/><br/>

<p align="center">

<br />
<br />
</p>

<h3>8. Clean Command</h3>

Then in the diskpart prompt I entered `clean` and pressed Enter. I made sure that I had the correct disk before proceeding knowing that this process will permanently erase all data on the selected disk. This was done by double-checking the disk number before proceeding, as wiping the wrong disk can have irreversible consequences.<br/><br/>

<h3>9. Dispart Succeeded</h3>

Once the process was finished, I saw a message indicating that Diskpart succeeded in cleaning the disk.</br></br>

After I was finished, I typed `exit` to leave Diskpart and closed the Command Prompt window.</br></br>

<h3>Summary</h3>

In this excerise, I demonstrated the use of diskpart to wipe a drive as a Cybersecurity Analyst. This example displayed how drives can easily be wiped for reuse.
